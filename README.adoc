This is a conversion of the popular https://github.com/jekyll/minima[minima] theme for Jekyll to primarily use AsciiDoc source files (instead of Markdown).

It uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc[Jekyll AsciiDoc Plugin].

== Making passthrough blocks work
To process liquid templates (e.g. `{% include my-themes-great-include.html %}`) inside asciidoc files / passthrough-blocks, you need to have `:page-liquid:` in the header

== Source code highlighting
The default way to do source code highlighting in Jekyll is by using Rouge (instead of pygments)
You can add highlighting into a page by simply setting `:page-liquid:` at the top of the correct asciidoc page.
The `scss` already contains definitions for the colors.
